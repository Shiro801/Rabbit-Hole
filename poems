            <h3>Delusions</h3>
            <p>I create delusions to escape reality<br>
            I daydream about what is imaginary<br>
            I talk to a mirror on the wall<br>
            Wondering when I will be called<br>
            But it declines<br>
            I'm just trying to keep my head in line<br>
            It runs away to the small world<br>
            It is made for me<br>
            Where I always be<br>
            Dreaming of something I’ll never see<br>
            Wondering If this was a reality<br>
            That is where I long to be<br>
            In a world that only I can see<br>
            I wake up in a world that isn't made for me<br>
            Thinking why it was made for me<br>
            In the end, I created a world in my head<br>
            Where I liked to be instead.</p>

            <h3>Mr. Rabbit</h3>
            <p>Mr rabbit tall and fair<br>
            Why are you always there?<br>
            Because of that I look at you and stare<br>
            Your eyes are like the galaxy<br>
            When I look at you I feel like I'm out of reality<br>
            You clear the darkest skies in my<br>
            I sit there and cry but you pull me out instead<br>
            His laugh stirred my head<br>
            I fell down the rabbit hole<br>
            Giving you my heart and soul<br>
            Your warm embrace<br>
            Never makes me feel hate<br>
            Even though I know I hate this state<br>
            Oh I love it and hate it at the same time<br>
            Just trying to keep my head in line<br>
            But it runs back to you where it likes to be instead<br>
            Just calling you a friend</p>

            <h3>Midori</h3>
            <p>I can spot you in the miss of the crowds<br>
            With a heart that is proud<br>
            A tall man with skin white and fair<br>
            look at him standing there<br>
            And he looked at me like there was something in me worth looking at<br>
            I wanted to feel nothing whenever I see him<br>
            but you looked at me in the eyes and I felt everything all at one-with eyes looking like the sun<br>
            And when I’m with him it’s enjoyable<br>
            This is the end for my eyes can no longer see<br>
            How you are just a friend to me</p>

            <h3>Sky Full of Stars</h3>
            <p>I always believe that when someone dies they become a dazzling star<br>
            Because of that I will always watch the night sky from afar<br>
            They leave their love as light<br>
            That will shine upon us on the deepest darkest nights<br>
            My love’s light<br>
            Is a very radiant sight<br>
            always takes away my fright<br>
            They left us there love as light<br>
            As they cross the rainbow bridge<br>
            They will always have courage<br>
            no pain, no suffering<br>
            I’m sorry that the world couldn’t keep you safe<br>
            But right now you have already found a soft and peaceful place<br>
            As you leave your love of light<br>
            That light will guide me in my path of life</p>

            <h3>My Ride Or Die</h3>
            <p>It doesn’t matter how long people knew each other<br>
            what matters is who walked with you in the darkness of the night and the light of the day<br>
            I cherish my friends to the point I couldn’t stay away<br>
            They are one of the foundations of my life<br>
            without them I would crumble<br>
            I need them to be stable<br>
            They are the only one’s who understand me and can bare my personality<br>
            They are the people who pull me back to reality<br>
            As I cry in the darkness of the night<br>
            they are the light that came to save me<br>
            As they know Im not ok they will never let me be<br>
            They always give me a shoulder to lean on<br>
            I have a strong bond with me friends<br>
            And I will cherish them to the end</p>

            <h3>Best</h3>
            <p>I miss you the most when I’m full of stories with no one to tell<br>
            When you pass by I feel like hell<br>
            You were always my partner in crime<br>
            What happened to all those times<br>
            I see our pictures on my phone<br>
            And ask myself why did you leave me alone<br>
            To my best friend<br>
            I thought our friendship would never end<br>
            You were my ride or die<br>
            I always thought that was right<br>
            I cry myself to sleep<br>
            Thinking of all our memorize<br>
            You introduced me to my happiness right now<br>
            I was always loyal to you because that was my vow<br>
            Even though it' was lonely and there was no place to lean on<br>
            Even though it was painful, and there was no place to stop<br>
            The earth it seemed like a deserted island to me<br>
            But at that time you were next to me<br>
            I believed you and I would fly<br>
            and run for our lives<br>
            As we would sore high in the dark sky<br>
            But I guess that will never happen<br>
            Love you to the moon and to Saturn<br>
            You are and will always be my best friend<br>
            And in my heart our friendship and memories<br>
            Will never end</p>

            <h3>Paraluman</h3>
            <p>Siya ay tanglaw<br>
            Kailangan araw-araw<br>
            Paraluman ko</p>

            <h3>Losing Battle</h3>
            <p>I fell deep down the rabbit hole<br>
            In a dark place with nowhere to go<br>
            Nothing but dark clouds and snow<br>
            Until I saw a glow<br>
            I walk towards the glow and see what it has to show<br>
            It was a tall man whose skin was white and fair<br>
            He said he would take me anywhere<br>
            But spending time with him gave me pain to bare<br>
            Not knowing when I’ll get there<br>
            Until my last breath I laid there and just stared<br>
            Thinking of the day we will meet again<br>
            So what will I do then?</p>

            <h3>My Mother</h3>
            <p>She is strong and brave<br>
            She can suppress thousands of waves<br>
            She is kind and smart<br>
            She also has a loving heart<br>
            She is my hero<br>
            A light that shines so bright<br>
            In the darkness of the night<br>
            Her courage is her crown and she wears it like a queen<br>
            She is beautiful inside and out<br>
            And that is never a doubt<br>
            She is my mother<br>
            And she is like no other</p>

            <h3>Moving On</h3>
            <p>And suddenly all the songs were about you<br>
            Because of that I didn't know what to do<br>
            Your voice is my favorite sound<br>
            It’s like saving when from chains I was bound<br>
            Where the light came in and I was found<br>
            You were the definition of in the world of boys his gentlemen<br>
            Where my heart could have been<br>
            But we were in the wrong place and time<br>
            Because we didn’t dare to not be disciplined<br>
            I hate that I’m still hoping<br>
            To the point I can’t stop coping<br>
            You were my comfort place<br>
            And that the feeling I do not want to erase<br>
            But I need to let go<br>
            So I could grow</p>
